üîê "Many roles, one goal": "Bug Bounty Hunter ‚Ä¢ Software Developer ‚Ä¢ AI Engineer ‚Ä¢ Reverse Engineer ‚Ä¢ Prompt Alchemist"


üõ† About Me~#

I‚Äôm ArkhAngelLifeJiggy a bug bounty hunter and web security enthusiast diving deep into the dark corners of code. I break systems to understand them, hunt critical vulnerabilities (P1 & P2), and build tools to empower the security community.



Passion:~# Cybersecurity, with a focus on web application security and ethical hacking.

Skills:~# Python, JavaScript, vulnerability assessment (XSS, SQLi, RCE), WAF bypass, and AI-driven security tools.

Platforms:~# Bugcrowd, HackerOne, and open-source projects.

Vibe:~# Breaking things to build them stronger. Always chasing the next exploit.



üå± Currently Learning~#

Ethical Hacking: Mastering advanced techniques for penetration testing, privilege escalation, and secure coding.

Exploring AI integration in cybersecurity for automated vuln scanning and reporting.



üíûÔ∏è Let‚Äôs Collaborate~#

Security researchers on bug bounty teams or private programs

Developers building secure-by-design applications

Open-source projects focused on security tooling or vulnerability research

AI engineers pushing the edge of LLM security & red teaming


I‚Äôm looking to team up on open-source cybersecurity projects, bug bounty tools, or ethical hacking initiatives. Got an idea for a tool, exploit, or vuln research? Let‚Äôs break some code together!



üìÇ Projects~#


Curl.py ‚Äì A Python-powered web security tool for automated enumeration, vulnerability scanning, and ethical exploitation. Built for bug bounty hunters to tackle RCE, SQLi, XSS, and more with WAF bypass techniques.

SuperSuprefFinder - advanced regex-based security scanner designed to discover sensitive information like API keys, passwords, tokens, and other secrets exposed within web applications and their associated JavaScript files

Script-Combo - The ultimate recon & mapping toolkit for bug bounty hunters! Automated recon, JS extraction, DOM mapping, reflection, sink & vuln checks, and more‚Äîall in one tool.

SubDom - powerful and flexible tool for subdomain and directory enumeration, designed for bug bounty hunting and web application reconnaissance. This script automates the discovery of potential attack vectors through passive and active scanning techniques

WebHound ‚Äì A robust tool for reconnaissance and directory enumeration across real-world targets like GitHub and Bugcrowd, optimized for reliability and efficiency.

SecurePredict ‚Äì A game-changing project for web application security, featuring production-ready snippets for detecting and exploiting vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs.

AIbot-bug -  AI-powered assistant designed to help bug bounty hunters, security researchers (red and blue teams), and anyone interested in web, network, and application security. It leverages the Gemini API to answer your questions related to reconnaissance, enumeration, mapping, vulnerability detection, exploitation, and general security concepts

Cybercode Universal AI: A versatile AI tool designed to answer queries across domains like cybersecurity and programming. It leverages models such as distilgpt2, t5-small, and distilbert-base-uncased to provide accurate responses for tasks like code analysis, vulnerability detection, and general knowledge queries. It supports bug bounty hunters by analyzing web application security issues, generating code snippets, and debugging, optimized for lightweight performance on CPU environments.

CyberReportGenAI: An AI-driven tool focused on generating comprehensive bug bounty reports. It automates the summarization of findings, formats reports for platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne, and ensures clarity and professionalism. It uses natural language processing (NLP) models like BERT and sentence-transformers to structure vulnerability details, prioritize critical issues (e.g., XSS, SQLi, RCE), and enhance report quality for submission.
