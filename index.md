🛠 About Me
I’m ArkhAngelLifeJiggy a bug bounty hunter and web security enthusiast diving deep into the dark corners of code. I break systems to understand them, hunt critical vulnerabilities (P1 & P2), and build tools to empower the security community. Proficient in Python and JavaScript, I craft solutions for real-world scenarios on platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne.

📂 Projects

Curl.py – A Python-powered web security tool for automated enumeration, vulnerability scanning, and ethical exploitation. Built for bug bounty hunters to tackle RCE, SQLi, XSS, and more with WAF bypass techniques.
SuperSuprefFinder - advanced regex-based security scanner designed to discover sensitive information like API keys, passwords, tokens, and other secrets exposed within web applications and their associated JavaScript files
Script-Combo - The ultimate recon & mapping toolkit for bug bounty hunters! Automated recon, JS extraction, DOM mapping, reflection, sink & vuln checks, and more—all in one tool.
SubDom - powerful and flexible tool for subdomain and directory enumeration, designed for bug bounty hunting and web application reconnaissance. This script automates the discovery of potential attack vectors through passive and active scanning techniques
WebHound – A robust tool for reconnaissance and directory enumeration across real-world targets like GitHub and Bugcrowd, optimized for reliability and efficiency.
SecurePredict – A game-changing project for web application security, featuring production-ready snippets for detecting and exploiting vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs.
AIbot-bug -  AI-powered assistant designed to help bug bounty hunters, security researchers (red and blue teams), and anyone interested in web, network, and application security. It leverages the Gemini API to answer your questions related to reconnaissance, enumeration, mapping, vulnerability detection, exploitation, and general security concepts
Cybercode Universal AI: A versatile AI tool designed to answer queries across domains like cybersecurity and programming. It leverages models such as distilgpt2, t5-small, and distilbert-base-uncased to provide accurate responses for tasks like code analysis, vulnerability detection, and general knowledge queries. It supports bug bounty hunters by analyzing web application security issues, generating code snippets, and debugging, optimized for lightweight performance on CPU environments.
CyberReportGenAI: An AI-driven tool focused on generating comprehensive bug bounty reports. It automates the summarization of findings, formats reports for platforms like Bugcrowd and HackerOne, and ensures clarity and professionalism. It uses natural language processing (NLP) models like BERT and sentence-transformers to structure vulnerability details, prioritize critical issues (e.g., XSS, SQLi, RCE), and enhance report quality for submission.


 ❤️I'm always open to working with:

Security researchers on bug bounty teams or private programs
Developers building secure-by-design applications
Open-source projects focused on security tooling or vulnerability research
AI engineers pushing the edge of LLM security & red teaming
